Trained networks and related variables are in the following two files:
mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_xy_12epoDrop_NetOnly.mat
mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_z_12epoDrop_NetOnly.mat

The following two files, which also contain the validation set to facilitate the performance evaluation,
are often loaded in our codes.
mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_xy_12epoDrop.mat
mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_z_12epoDrop.mat

which are also avaialbe in Kaggle
