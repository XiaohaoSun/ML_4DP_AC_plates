Trained networks and related variables are in the following two mat files:

mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_xy_12epoDrop_NetOnly.mat

mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_z_12epoDrop_NetOnly.mat


The following two mat files, which also contain the validation set to facilitate the performance evaluation,
are used in most codes.

mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_xy_12epoDrop.mat

mat_netD2s_f5convBCxyzEnd_z_12epoDrop.mat

They are avaialbe in Kaggle
